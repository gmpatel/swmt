Technical assignment
====================

The purpose of this assignment is to review your experience in .NET (either 4.6
or dotnetcore) & C#. Even thought that the underlying task itself is very simple;
we will be looking at following when analysing your solution;

  * Structure of your application
  * Testability
  * Reusability
  * Readability
  * Performance

In a nutshell, it needs to be “production quality”.

Supplied
========

Example file formatted with JSON on every row
e.g.
{ "id": 31, "first": "Jill", "last": "Scott", "age":66 }

Note: It might or might not be a valid JSON structure.

Delivery
========
1. Please use github – send us the link once you have completed the brief.

Task
====
Please write a console application that outputs (no interaction needed):

  * The users full name for id=42
  * All the users first names (comma separated) who are 23
  * The number of genders per Age, displayed from youngest to oldest
    e.g
        Age : 17 Female: 2 Male: 3
        Age : 18 Female: 6 Male: 3

Considerations
==============

  1. The data source may change.
  2. The way source is fetched may change.
  3. The number of records may change (performance).
  4. The functionality may not always be consumed in a console app.
